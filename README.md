## Lessons Learned

This project helped me understand the following React concepts in depth:

1. **Event Listeners**: Handling click events and input changes to update the UI dynamically.
2. **State Management**: Managing application data using React's `useState` hook.
3. **Conditional Rendering**: Displaying components or elements conditionally based on the application state.
4. **Forms**: Capturing user input and using it effectively within the app.
5. **Side Effects**: Fetching data using React's `useEffect` hook.
